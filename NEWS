h5utils 1.12 (6/12/09)

  * The vertical axis in h5topng is now reversed to correspond to
    what most people seem to expect: increasing coordinates correspond
    to "up" and "right" in the image, rather than "down" and "right"
    in the image as in previous versions.

  * Fixed failure in h5tovtk -2; thanks to Karen Lee for the bug report.

  * Fixed installation of h5read.oct for Octave 3.x.

h5utils 1.11.1 (4/28/08)

  * Fixed failure to find colormap files in h5topng 1.11 (due
    to changes in autoconf 2.60); thanks to bug report from Jiangjun Zheng.

h5utils 1.11 (4/24/08)

  * h5tovtk no longer reverses the dimensions; thanks to Andreas Wilde
    for the suggestion.

  * Fix compilation failure with HDF5 1.8.

h5utils 1.10.1 (9/20/06)

  * Fixed build problem on Cygwin due to missing ".exe" extension. 
    Thanks to Ken Hill for the bug report.

h5utils 1.10 (9/2/05)

  * Added h4fromh5 utility.  (NCSA seems to be no longer shipping
    the HDF5/HDF4 conversion tools with the latest HDF5 release.)

  * Added dkbluered color map, which is similar to bluered but
    uses a somewhat wider range of colors.

h5utils 1.9.1 (8/5/04)

  * Fix h5topng compilation failure with some non-C99 compilers;
    thanks to Maarten van Reeuwijk for the bug report.

h5utils 1.9 (7/12/04)

  * Added new h5math utility, which creates and combines HDF5 datasets
    using a user-specified mathematical expression.  (Requires GNU
    libmatheval to be installed.)

  * h5topng: Matlab-like start:end or start:step:end notation for
    slice indices, to allow a whole sequence of slices to be output as
    a sequence of PNG images.

  * h5topng: if contour/overlay dataset does not have same dimensions
    as output data, it is periodically "tiled" over the output.

h5utils 1.8 (5/22/04)

  * New -A and -a options for h5topng to allow translucent overlays
    from one file onto another (an alternative or complement to the
    -C contour-overlay option).

  * h5topng uses 24-bit direct color by default (use -8 option for
    old 8-bit behavior).

  * h5topng uses columns/rows for x/y by default (use -T to swap),
    the opposite of the old behavior.

  * There is no default -z 0 slice dimension in h5topng/h5totxt any more.
    You must specify a slice for 3+ dimensional data in h5topng.
    h5totxt dumps the whole data file by default unless one or more
    slices are specified.

  * Support specifying multiple slice dimensions for 4+ dimensional
    datasets, with new "-t" option to indicate final dimension.

  * Slices are also supported now in h5tovtk and h5tov5d.

  * New -. option in h5totxt to specify number of significant digits; 
    output 16 digits by default instead of 6, previously.

h5utils 1.7.1 (3/16/02)

  * Fixed array overrun in h5topng that caused a floating-point exception
    on Alphas; thanks to Marin Soljacic for the bug report.

h5utils 1.7 (3/9/02)

  * h5topng now supports multiple, user-definable color tables, a number
    of which are provided.  INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: the -c option now has
    the syntax: -c <colortable>.  The old behavior corresponds to the
    included "bluered" colortable, invoked via: -c bluered.

  * New -R option for h5topng to use a consistent color scale for
    all specified files.

  * New -0 option for h5topng and h5totxt that shifts the origin of the
    slice coordinates to the dataset center.

  * Added h5tovtk program to output VTK (Visualization ToolKit) data files.

  * Support -T (transpose dimensions) option in h5tov5d.

  * Fixed bug in h5topng that caused extra rows/columns of garbage pixels
    to be written at the edges of images when scaling was used.

  * When compiling the h5read Octave plugin, respect the CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS 
    environment variables.  Thanks to Max Colice for the bug report.

  * Fixed problem when --without-h5tov5d and --without-h5fromh4 are used. 
    Thanks to Nikola Ivanov Nikolov for the fix.

h5utils 1.6 (1/17/01)

  * Don't build h5fromh4 if the superior h4toh5 tool (from HDF5 1.4)
    is present.  Also added --{with,without}-h5fromh4 option to
    configure to force whether h5fromh4 is built.

h5utils 1.5.1 (12/9/00)

  * Support manually disabling Octave plugin support
    (configure --without-octave) in case of C++ problems.

  * Support Vis5d+ and Debian HDF header file locations.

h5utils 1.5 (7/9/00)

  * Added h5fromh4 program to convert HDF4 datasets to HDF5 format.

  * Added -S <s> option to h5topng as a shortcut for -X <s> -Y <s>.

h5utils 1.4 (5/28/00)

  * Added h5fromtxt program to convert text input to an HDF5 dataset.

h5utils 1.3.4 (1/31/00)

  * Improved -C contour plotting in h5topng.

  * Fix in h5topng man page (thanks to Christoph Becher).

h5utils 1.3.3 (1/30/00)

  * Bug fix in h5topng (would sometimes output solid black images).
    Thanks to Karl Koch for the bug report.

h5utils 1.3.2 (1/28/00)

  * Added h5topng -Z option to center color scale on zero.

  * Now support h5topng -C filename:dataset.

h5utils 1.3.1 (1/27/00)

  * Bug fixes in dataset name-handling, especially when using h5tov5d to
    join multiple datasets into one output file.

h5utils 1.3 (1/21/00)

  * You can now specify individual datasets within a file by using
    <filename>:<dataset> instead of just <filename> with h5topng,
    h5totxt, and h5tov5d.

h5utils 1.2.3: (1/20/00)

  * Fixed minor bug in 'h5totxt -h'.

h5utils 1.2.2: (1/12/00)

  * Makefile now includes CPPFLAGS in the compiler flags, making it
    easier to use header files in non-standard locations.  (CPPFLAGS
    is the proper place to put -I flags for the configure script.)

h5utils 1.2.1:  (1/1/00)

  * Modified -o option of h5tov5d to join datasets into a single Vis5d file.

h5utils 1.2:  (12/31/99)

  * Added h5tov5d program for converting to Vis5d format.

  * Improved installation; h5read.oct now goes into the sitewide Octave
    plugins directory, and things work correctly when only some of the
    utilities are compiled.

h5utils 1.1:  (12/6/99)

  * Added h5totxt program for exporting 2d slices of HDF5 files to text
    suitable for importing into a spreadsheet.

h5utils 1.0:  (11/22/99)

  * Initial release.
