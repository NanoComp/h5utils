.TH H5TOTXT 1 "March 9, 2002" "h5utils" "h5utils"
.SH NAME
h5totxt \- generate comma-delimited text from 2d slices of HDF5 files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B h5totxt
[\fIOPTION\fR]... [\fIHDF5FILE\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.\" Add any additional description here
h5totxt is a utility to generate comma-delimited text (and similar
formats) from one-, two-, or more-dimensional slices of numeric
datasets in HDF5 files.  This way, the data can easily be imported
into spreadsheets and similar programs for analysis and visualization.

HDF5 is a free, portable binary format and supporting library developed
by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University
of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign.  A single
.I h5
file can contain multiple data sets; by default,
.I h5totxt
takes the first dataset, but this can be changed via the
.B -d
option, or by using the syntax \fIHDF5FILE:DATASET\fR.

By default, the entire dataset is dumped to the output.  in row-major
order.  For 3d datasets, this corresponds to a sequence of yz slices,
in order of increasing x, separated by blank lines.  If
.B -T
is specified, outputs in the transposed (column-major) order instead

Often, however, you want only a one- or two-dimensional slice of
multi-dimensional data.  To do this, you specify coordinates in one or
more slice dimensions, via the
.B -xyzt
options.

The most basic usage is something like \(aqh5totxt foo.h5\(aq, which will
output comma-delimited text to stdout from the data in foo.h5.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -h
Display help on the command-line options and usage.
.TP
.B -V
Print the version number and copyright info for h5totxt.
.TP
.B -v
Verbose output.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR \fIfile\fR
Send text output to
.I file
rather than to stdout (the default).
.TP
\fB\-s\fR \fIsep\fR
Use the string
.I sep
to separate columns of the output rather than a comma (the default).
.TP
\fB\-x\fR \fIix\fR, \fB\-y\fR \fIiy\fR, \fB\-z\fR \fIiz\fR, \fB\-t\fR \fIit\fR
This tells
.I h5totxt
to use a particular slice of a multi-dimensional dataset.  e.g.
.B -x
causes a yz plane (of a 3d dataset) to be used, at an x index of
.I ix
(where the indices run from zero to one less than the maximum index in
that direction).  Here, x/y/z correspond to the first/second/third
dimensions of the HDF5 dataset. The \fB\-t\fR option specifies a slice
in the last dimension, whichever that might be.  See also the
.B -0
option to shift the origin of the x/y/z slice coordinates to the
dataset center.
.TP
.B -0
Shift the origin of the x/y/z slice coordinates to the dataset center,
so that e.g. -0 -x 0 (or more compactly -0x0) returns the central x
plane of the dataset instead of the edge x plane.  (\fB\-t\fR
coordinates are not affected.)
.TP
.B -T
Transpose the data (interchange the dimension ordering).  By default, no
transposition is done.
.TP
\fB\-.\fR \fInumdigits\fR
Output
.I numdigits
digits after the decimal point (defaults to 16).
.TP
\fB\-d\fR \fIname\fR
Use dataset
.I name
from the input files; otherwise, the first dataset from each file is used.
Alternatively, use the syntax \fIHDF5FILE:DATASET\fR, which allows you
to specify a different dataset for each file.
You can use the
.I h5ls
command (included with hdf5) to find the names of datasets within a file.
